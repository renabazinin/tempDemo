## Features

- **Interactive Temperature Control**: Adjust the temperature slider to see how it affects AI responses
- **Dual Scenarios**: Test with coding prompts (The Coder) and creative prompts (The Poet)
- **Real-time Visualization**: See immediate results and understand temperature's impact
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React and TailwindCSS
